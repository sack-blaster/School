My name is Jacob, and I am a junior at SDSU majoring in physics with a minor in computer science. Some of my hobbies are hiking, 
playing various sports, playing music, video games, learning, spending time with friends and family, and apparently giving my fellow
classmates a hard time reading introductions.
